veg samosa in pure olive oil.To begin making the dough for the samosa crust, combine all the ingredients for the dough in a large mixing bowl.\\nRub the olive oil into the flour till you see coarse crumbs.Add  little water at a time and knead to make a firm and yet smooth dough.\\nCover the dough and keep it aside to rest while we prepare the Chinese filling.For the stuffing, heat olive oil in a wok or a heavy bottomed pan.\\nAdd the ginger, garlic, green chilies and spring onions and stir fry for a few seconds until you can smell the aromas coming through.Add the carrots, beans, capsicum and cabbage and stir fry on high heat until it is cooked through.\\nThe vegetables will be cooked yet firm.Once done, add the cooked noodles, that are roughly chopped, the chili sauce, salt and pepper.\\nStir together until the filling is combined with all the ingredients.\\nCheck the taste and adjust the salt and chili.Turn off the heat and keep the filling aside to cool.Preheat the oil for
